# Contributing to TxProof

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This project is a **Monorepo** managed by npm workspaces.

## Development Setup

### 1. Installation

We use the root `package.json` to manage dependencies for all apps and packages.

```bash
# Install everything
npm install
```

### 2. Project Structure

-   `apps/web`: Next.js Frontend & Client-side Print Engine.
-   `apps/api`: Node.js/Express Backend & Semantic Classifier.
-   `packages/contracts`: Smart Contracts & ABIs.
-   `packages/domain`: Shared TypeScript interfaces.
-   `packages/database`: SQL Schema & Migrations.

### 3. Running Locally

**Start Everything:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Start Specific App:**
```bash
npm run dev -w apps/web
# OR
npm run dev -w apps/api
```

### 4. Working with Shared Packages

If you modify a shared package (e.g., `packages/domain`):
1.  Make your changes in `packages/domain/src`.
2.  The changes are immediately available to apps (via TypeScript path mapping/symlinks).
3.  If you add a new dependency to a package, run `npm install` at the root.

### 5. PDF Generation
The PDF engine has been migrated to a **Client-Side** architecture for high-fidelity printing.
-   **Backend**: `apps/api` handles transaction resolution, classification, and data caching (Soft Queue).
-   **Frontend**: `apps/web/src/app/print/bill/[id]` handles the visual rendering and `window.print()` trigger.
-   **Styles**: Print-specific layouts are managed in `apps/web/src/styles/print.css`.
-   **Verification**: Run `npm run test:verification -w apps/api` to test the backend resolution logic.

## Code Style

-   **Strict Boundaries**:
    -   Common types -> `packages/domain`
    -   Frontend code -> `apps/web` (Never import from `api`)
    -   Backend code -> `apps/api`
-   **Secrets**: Use `.env` files in App directories only.
